# Batch 01
# Mini payment gateway simulator 
## Project overview
 This project is a simulation of how gateway works behind the scenes (system).
 It mainly shows how payments moves step by step through different stages like starting from created, moving to processing and finally ending in either success or failure.
 The main goal of this project is to demonstrate clean backend architecture, well-structured state management, and strong error handling practices, just like in real-world systems.
